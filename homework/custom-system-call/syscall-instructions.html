		<h1>Instructions for creating your own syscall in Ubuntu-Trusty</h1>	 	
		<h2>Getting and building the kernel</h2>
		
		<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
		
		<p>1.A system running Ubuntu. This can be either a computer or to play it safe a virtual machine(which was what the author did)</br>
		   2.git</br>
		   3.make</br>
		   4.gcc</br>
		   5.dpkg</br>
		   6.gedit</br></p>

		<p>These are packages that should be installed to your system in order to build the new kernel. Most of these should seem familiar except 
			possibly for fakeroot.This package tricks programs into thinking that they have root priveleges and execute. Aside from these packages
			the build environment needs to be setup. This can be done with the following command.</br></br>
		<code>sudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)</code></p>
		   
		<h3>1.Downloading the Source Code</h3>   
		<p>The Ubuntu source code can be found within their git repository. This is not a typical git repository from GitHub but rather a private git repository. The command to clone Ubuntu Trusty is as follows</br></br>
		<code>git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-trusty.git</code></br></br>
		With this complete the directory titled ubuntu-trusty should appear. This contains the entire source code that will be needed. It should be noted that this is a hefty folder with roughly 12 GB worth of information. Be prepared for a length download time.</p>	
		
		<h3>2.Building the Kernel</h3> 
		<p>The following two steps will build the kernel as well as clean it</br></br>
		<code>fakeroot debian/rules clean</br>
		   fakeroot debian.rules binary-headers binary-generic</code></br></br>
		   These steps should result in about five debian files (.deb). As a warning the second step took roughly 3-4 hours using a 3 GB RAM virtual machine. It should be noted that it is possible to configure which files are built in order to reduce the build time but this tutorial will not delve into the commands for that.</p>
		
		<h3>3.Installing the kernel</h3>
		<p>The next step requires the installation of the kernel from the .deb files. The dpkg command will be used on the .deb files. The command below will ensure that process.</br></br>
		<code>sudo dpkg -i *.deb</code></br></br>
		   Upon doing this the next step is simply to restart the machine and the new kernel will be automatically implemented upon boot. The following command is one way to reboot the machine.</br></br>
		<code>sudo reboot</code></br></br>
		When the computer restarts the new kernel should be the version running. You can check the version with the following command</br></br>
		<code>uname -r</code></p>

		<h2>Creating the custom system call for x86 processor</h2>
		<h3>1.Adding system call to system call table</h3>
		<p>This step involves changing all the possible system call tables to include the custom system call table. For the sake of this tutorial the system call will be named helloworld. </br></br>
		In order to add the system call to the table the system call needs to be added to the 32-bit table and given a number. The number changes based on the version being used. During the writing of this tutorial the number was 351.
		   The following lines of code show the both the file and the line that needs to be added.</br></br>
		   <code>arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl</br>
		   351     i386     sys_helloworld        sys_helloworld</code></br></br>
		   The number 351 is the system call number that belongs to this particular system call.</p>

		<h3>2.Adding to the Syscall header</h3>
		<p>This step is meant to allow the C program to be used amongst various programs.The following two lines dictate the file and the line of code to be appended</br></br>
		<code>include/linux.syscalls.h</br></br>
		   asmlinkage long sys_helloworld(void);</br></code></p>
		
		<h3>3.Creating the system call code</h3>
		<p>4.With all the preparation the system call code now needs to be written. Be sure to create a directory for the code. Be sure it has the name you have given the system call. For the sake of this tutorial a simple code will be provided.</br></br>
		<code>#include <linux/kernel.h></br>
		   asmlinkage long sys_hello(void) {</br>
			printk("Hello World\n");</br>
		    return 0;</br>
		   }</br></code></p>
		
		<h3>4.The Makefiles</h3>
		<p>Within the same directory that the system call code was created create a document titled Makefile. Within the document type in the following line.</br></br>
		<code>obj-y := "systemname".o</code></br></br>
		   This will ensure that the system call C code is compiled and included in the kernel. Moving up one level in the directory there should be another Makefile document. This should be opened with a text editor and the following line or something similar should be found.</br></br>
		<code>core-y += kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/</code></br></br>
		   This could should be appended to look like this.</br></br>
		<code>core-y += kernel/ mm/ fs/ ipc/ security/ crypto/ block/ helloworld</code></br></br>
		
		Note that there are spaces after every /. This is important and should be included.</p>

		<p><b>Congratulations!!</b> You now have a custom call that should be included in the kernel the next time it is built. You can redo steps 2 & 3 from the "Getting and building the kernel" instructions to build it.</p>

		<h2>Testing your custom system call</h2>
		<p>You can create a simple C code that will invoke the custom system call.Here is a quick C code for that purpose.</br></br>
		<code>#include <stdio.h></br>
          #include <linux/kernel.h></br>
          #include <sys/syscall.h></br>
          #include <unistd.h></br></br>
          
          long helloworld_syscall(void) {</br></br>
          
              return syscall(351);</br></br>
            
          }</br></br>
          
          int main(int argc, char *argv[])</br>
          {</br>
              long int a = helloworld_syscall();</br>
              printf("System call returned %ld\n", a);</br>
              return 0;</br>
          }</code></p>

		<p>The printk command from the system call prints to the kernel log. In order to see the printed items the following line can be used.</br></br>
		<code>dmesg</code></br></br>
		   This will print the kernel log and should show your system calls message. This will update accordingly. All that is left is to gcc the code to call the custom system call and execute it. The text "Hello World" should appear on the log.</p>

		<p>With this you have sucesfully created your own system call and tested it.</p>
