There are two main programs to run here. diningPhilosophersComplete is the entire dining philosophers code packed into one text
file. The second requires running make. While the complete version has everything in it there is no modularization. As such an 
attempt was made to modularize and the result is needing to run make. This will create the file to be run by the user to see the
modularized version running. Although they should be the same one may perform better than the other.
